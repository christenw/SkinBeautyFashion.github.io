    <h2> Amira Lester</h2>
    <p> Hi! My name is Amira Lester. I am 16 years old going onto my Junior year
      of high school. I like to read, draw and take care of children younger than
      me. Throughout my entire middle and high school education experience I have
      been taking Honors and AP classes. I was inspired into contributing into the
      fashion advice because I believe everyone has a different aspect on fashion.

    <h2> Christen Woods</h2>
    <p>Hey! My name is Christen, I’m 15 years old, and I currently attend North Atlanta High School where I’m in the 11th grade. My interests are dance, swim, science, and anything that has to do with beauty. Ever since I was little I’ve always been a girly girl. To this day I’ve carried these traits with me, and that is what has made me so passionate about making this website.

A lady named Molly Tilghman once summed up the 18th century perspective on beauty in this way:
"Wisdom says beauty is a fading flower — but it attracts more admiration than wit, goodness, or anything else in the world."
