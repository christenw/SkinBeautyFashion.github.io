    <h1> Introduction To Beauty </h1>
    <p> Beauty-a combination of qualities, such as shape, color, or form, that pleases the aesthetic senses, especially the sight
Beauty is essential it is who you are. You express your feelings through your beauty beauty is a feeling it is your mood it is your quality.
Often times beauty is expressed through your facial appearance where either you have on makeup or just your natural appearance.Most times when you hear someone talk about beauty it is a beauty brand or something in that nature but when I talk about beauty it is not the makeup you wear, im speaking on you as a person. Are you being beautiful inside and out? Is your vibes beautiful? Are you a beautiful person to be a round? Before I touch on the make up point of view on beauty you have to make sure that your natural beauty is up to part and that your not trying to cover up the mess. Because no matter how much makeup you put on if your not beautiful inside and out then there's no point.
